### Careful

This is the construction of an engineering project after personal learning, completed on 23.4.13

Has timeliness, and the libraries used in the project update over time

For updates whose usage will not change, delete the lock && node_modules file and reinstall it using the npm/yarn/pnpm package manager

For significant updates (which rarely occur), there may be differences. It is recommended to consider based on my recent maintenance time
